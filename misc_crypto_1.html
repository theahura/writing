        Web3 is the new polarizing thing. Everyone has opinions about it — it
        feels like everyone has to have opinions about it — and so lots of
        people are saying lots of things and most of it is noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not a Web3 enthusiast. Full disclosure, I have about 10-15k
        invested in eth, most of that coming from an investment I made back in
        2017. I tend to swing back and forth between bearish and bullish on the
        overall idea. I have some very smart friends who I respect deeply on
        both sides of Web3, so I guess it makes sense that I would end up being
        more or less neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        But man. People on every side of this thing are just spouting insane
        bullshit! Enough that I wanted to write down my own opinions, so that I
        can keep some sense of what's real and what isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        One caveat before diving in: I don't <i>think</i> any of the takes
        below are straw men, but I'm happy to be proven wrong and will
        update/issue corrections as needed.

      </p>
      <h6>Part 1: let's talk about the hype men.</h6>
      <p>
        Web3 is being touted as a financial technology. I think it is more than
        that, but certainly the initial use case of Web3 — crypto currencies —
        is finance. As a result, the crypto space has drawn a massive
        population of…let's call them financial professionals. These are people
        whose job description is, to a first order approximation, "professional
        gambler". There is great value in market making and providing liquidity
        for complex assets — in fact, these two roles of the financial system
        allow everything else to function — but the people that make these
        markets work are not inherently interested in anything beyond 'will the
        line go up'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto is undoubtedly in the middle of a massive speculative bubble. A
        <i>ton</i> of people who are talking about Web3 don't know what it is
        or how it works. This has led to some pretty bizarre claims, some of
        which I want to tackle here.
      </p>
      <p><b>No, Web3 will not "solve" centralization.</b></p>
      <p>
        A lot of crypto enthusiasts hear 'crypto is decentralized' and
        extrapolate to 'a web3 future will be decentralized'. This is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        First: centralization is really fucking useful! Centralization allows
        for economies of scale, which in turn reduces global costs. There are
        entire areas of technological and infrastructural development that are
        so costly, they are completely out of reach without centralization
        (see: most government projects).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second: centralization is a social phenomenon, driven by the above. If
        Amazon is offering cheaper prices than Barnes and Noble, everyone is
        locally incentivized to shop at Amazon, and everyone is locally
        incentivized to sell on Amazon. Similarly, if OpenSea has all the
        buyers and sellers, it will continue to gain all of the buyers and
        sellers until something more disruptive comes along. This is the
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_3.html"
          >entire point of building moats</a
        >. Protip: most VC backed tech companies would not exist if there was
        no moat to build.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of people have written about this, but it bears repeating:
        centralization is already endemic in web3. If OpenSea unilaterally
        decides that you shouldn't have access to an NFT, good luck buying or
        selling the thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >No, Web3 will not "solve" how companies are organized. (Or: DAOs are
          [mostly] stupid)</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        DAO stands for "decentralized autonomous organization" — the basic idea
        behind a DAO is that people can buy tokens that correspond to voting
        rights, which in turn can be used to do…something. It varies per DAO.
      </p>
      <p>
        A certain kind of crypto enthusiast loves DAOs. Their discords are
        filled with DAO servers. And some popular DAOs have managed to raise
        obscene amounts of money (<a
          href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/"
          >eg</a
        >). The promise of DAOs is that the average person can have some say in
        how an organization is run, allowing them to influence larger amounts
        of capital than they might individually have access to.
      </p>
      <p>
        DAOs were invented in the 1600s by the Dutch East India Company. They
        used different terminology — shares, instead of tokens, but the idea is
        the same. If you own shares in a company, you have voting rights that
        allow you to directly impact how that company does business.
      </p>
      <p>Modern web3 DAOs are strictly worse than shares.</p>
      <p>
        DAOs lose all protections that have been developed over the last 400
        years. Many DAOs are scams. They are obscure — if you put your money
        in, you do not have any guarantee about what happens to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        DAOs are exposed to the worst parts of financial misbehavior and all of
        the worst parts of technical misbehavior. Many DAOs are structured as a
        pot of money, which means there are massive 'bounties' in place that
        incentivize hackers or scammers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many DAOs require some real world action to be taken — assets or labor
        to be bought or sold, like
        <a
          href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/"
          >buying a constitution</a
        >
        or
        <a
          href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22950868/spice-dao-crypto-jodorowsky-dune-bible-collective-writing-contest"
          >paying for animators</a
        >. This means that someone, a single person, is responsible for
        transferring the funds from the DAO out of the crypto space. If that
        person fucks up, or worse just walks away, there is no enforcement
        mechanism to get the funds back. In the real world, shareholders have
        rights that are backed by the courts, which in turn are backed by guns.
        DAOs are backed by memes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Web3 won't 'solve' centralization, DAOs definitely won't solve
        centralization. Rich people can always buy more tokens in a DAO than
        you can. That means that rich people will have more control, much like
        how shares work in public companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, let's imagine a hypothetical ideal case where DAO
        token-holders are somehow actually able to enforce some kind of
        democratic will on some company or organization. This sucks. In the
        existing financial system, shareholders have the power to elect board
        members; simplifying a bit, the board has exactly one power, which is
        to fire the CEO/executive team. There are two layers of indirection
        between the public and the operators of the company. This is a good
        thing — the executive team almost tautologically understands the inner
        workings of a company better than everyone else, and so can make
        maximally efficient decisions for the sake of the company. For many
        companies, the members of the executive team are also the majority
        shareholders. By removing these layers of indirection, DAOs end up
        exposing companies to a lot more risk of hostile takeover, or just
        incompetant management by <s>share</s> token-holders who lack
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I actually do think DAOs do have interesting uses — for
        example,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)"
          >creating a hedge fund without a hedge fund manager</a
        >, operated entirely through smart contracts. It's not clear to me that
        such a hedge fund would perform better than a normal hedge fund, but
        it's an interesting idea!
      </p>
      <p>
        But most DAOs are being presented by crypto hype men as a way for the
        'masses' to take 'decentralized control'. That's smoke and mirrors.
        These guys are selling bridges, they want control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >We absolutely should NOT move all data to a block chain. (Or: Web2
          is amazing)</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Every now and then, you'll hear someone say something like 'it would be
        great if medical records were on the block chain!'
      </p>
      <p>No. It wouldn't be great. It would be awful.</p>
      <p>
        There are ongoing, massive movements to protect user privacy, from both
        legislative and technological angles. These movements are in direct
        response to the collection and publicization of huge amounts of user
        data, which in turn has contributed to an increase in identity theft
        and fraud at every level. So when I say that PII should not go on
        public ledgers, it is hopefully obvious why.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of good reasons to keep data off a block chain. Privacy
        is a big one. Another big one is speed. Block chains have more complex
        read/write protocols that necessarily make them slower than other
        databases. If you are building a system that requires some kind of
        internal memory (most systems!) you should stick to web2 technology. If
        you have to use decentralization, git solves 99% of the Web3 use cases
        I've heard of. If you can't explain why git is insufficient for your
        problem, you haven't thought deeply enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, almost everything you can do with web3 can be done more
        easily with web2 (there are a few exceptions that I cover at the end).
        But because many people in crypto don't understand how crypto actually
        works, I think that they are stuck rehashing web2. For every popular
        web3 application, I try to think about how it could be done in web2.
        Most of the time, it's strictly better to implement in web2.
      </p>
      <p><b>A few other hot takes</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Web3 is not meaningfully anonymous. Because of centralization, most
          people will be interacting with Web3 in a de-anonymized way from the
          beginning. But even if you were running your own wallet (no metamask,
          no central exchanges) every single transaction is tied to a single
          wallet or set of wallets, and is publicly available. Unmasking any
          wallet therefore allows one to reverse engineer an entire transaction
          chain. Eventually, the crypto needs to turn into real money, which is
          a very tricky point of failure (<a
            href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency"
            >1</a
          >,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/0xZuwu/status/1437921263394115584">2</a
          >). My personal hunch is that the three letter agencies invented
          bitcoin for exactly this reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trustless is not inherently better. Trusted entities (up to and
          including the government) make life easier. If you are doing
          something that actually requires trustlessness, it's either illegal
          or you live in a failed state. (Goes along with 'centralization is
          not inherently worse')
        </li>
        <li>
          Nothing about Web3 is beneficial to the 'little guy'. Most crypto
          currency implementations are deflationary, meaning rich early
          adopters get all the say — just like the status quo. (EDIT: A good
          friend called me out on this and pointed to airdrops as a means of
          giving users stake in a company. He compared this to getting shares
          for supporting early startups like Google, Uber, Spotify. In the
          status quo, you need to be an accredited investor to do this, because
          the SEC regulates who gets shares how; in Web3 world, those
          regulations dont exist, so more people can get shares for a wider
          variety of reasons. So, MOST things about Web3 CURRENTLY are not
          beneficial to the little guy.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Stop conflating 'the metaverse' with web3. What the fuck do these
          things even have to do with each other? The connection is tenuous at
          best, nonexistent if we're being honest.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Closing Thoughts</b></p>
      <p>
        Critical takes on crypto hype men is becoming its own genre, and as a
        result there are more articulate people than I writing about the
        subject. I recommend
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g&ab_channel=FoldingIdeas"
          >Line Goes Up</a
        >, which makes a very strong case against the current state of Web3. I
        also recommend
        <a
          href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine"
          >Matt Levine</a
        >, who often talks about Web3 in his Bloomberg column. Finally, I
        recommend Moxie Marlinspike's (founder of Signal)

        from earlier this year that deservedly went pseudo-viral.
