        Web3 is the new polarizing thing. Everyone has opinions about it — it
        feels like everyone has to have opinions about it — and so lots of
        people are saying lots of things and most of it is noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not a Web3 enthusiast. Full disclosure, I have about 10-15k
        invested in eth, most of that coming from an investment I made back in
        2017. I tend to swing back and forth between bearish and bullish on the
        overall idea. I have some very smart friends who I respect deeply on
        both sides of Web3, so I guess it makes sense that I would end up being
        more or less neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        But man. People on every side of this thing are just spouting insane
        bullshit! Enough that I wanted to write down my own opinions, so that I
        can keep some sense of what's real and what isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        One caveat before diving in: I don't <i>think</i> any of the takes
        below are straw men, but I'm happy to be proven wrong and will
        update/issue corrections as needed.

      <h6>Part 2: Now let's talk about the haters.</h6>
      <p>
        Like I said, Web3 is polarizing and everyone has to have an opinion.
        Crypto currencies have also made a ton of people incredibly wealthy,
        which means a ton of other people were left out of the
        'thing-that-made-people-incredibly-wealthy'. I think some people are
        upset about this.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's obvious that a lot of folks talking about why Web3 sucks also have
        no idea what Web3 is. Most of them are stuck repeating outdated talking
        points, likely sourced from Twitter. I think Web3 is actually
        innovative in a lot of ways, and as a startup founder I naturally hate
        when someone dismisses a cool idea because of
        obvious-reasons-everyone-in-the-field-has-already-thought-about. So
        here are a few 'crypto takedowns' that need to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >If you're griping about transaction rates and costs, you have no
          idea what's going on.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A pretty common talking point against Web3 is that transactions are
        expensive. In their minds, here's why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          in order to record a transaction (or store data) on a block chain,
          you need to update the chain with the new information;
        </li>
        <li>
          because Web3 is decentralized, any schmuck has access to the chain
          and can add new information;
        </li>
        <li>
          this causes all sorts of problems, so we need a way to control who
          can add to the chain when;
        </li>
        <li>
          for complicated reasons, this process is slow and costs money (I'm
          not simplifying here -- I think this is about where most crypto
          enthusiasts and detractors knowledge actually ends).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For a technology that is supposed to be a medium of exchange, expensive
        transactions are a slam dunk argument against. QED, crypto is stupid,
        go home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except…everyone in the Web3 space knows that transactions are slow and
        expensive. And the web3 community has long since solved this problem.
        The solution is an 'l2 network'. The basic idea is to combine a bunch
        of transactions on the l2 network, and then only make them 'real' in a
        large combined batch. This allows transactions to be instantaneous for
        all intents and purposes, and distributes costs across all the people
        in the l2 network. I first heard about these in 2012. As a sophomore.
        In highschool. (In 2022, you have no excuse)
      </p>
      <p>
        If this sounds crazy to you, I hope you don't use paypal or venmo.
        Because that's the exact same idea. (Guess what: transactions in the
        'real world' were so slow and expensive that venmo became a verb!)
      </p>
      <p><b>Even in its current state, Web3 has meaningful value.</b></p>
      <p>
        I think some people heard that crypto was overvalued, and interpreted
        that to mean that crypto has 0 'real' value. These people might say
        things like 'the value of crypto will inevitably go to 0'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most popular existing use cases for Web3 are crypto currencies —
        international, unregulated speculative assets. No one party has
        oversight over the popular crypto currencies. Further, the popular
        crypto currencies have legitimate offramps into fiat currencies in most
        jurisdictions — including, most importantly, USD.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that 'the value of crypto will inevitably go to 0', you
        are stating that there is no value in having a globally unregulated
        mechanism for converting financial assets into USD. This is naive.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, people do things that are illegal. If you do something illegal,
        and try to use fiat currency to profit off that thing, you are very
        likely to be caught. As a result, one of the earliest and most fervent
        adopters of crypto currencies was the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)"
          >Silk Road</a
        >. In general, many transactions on the dark net occur entirely in
        crypto. These sorts of transactions have value — not in the sense that
        they are good, but rather that they provide actual economic output in
        the same way buying a burger does. These days, when the CIA sends funds
        to rebel terrorist groups, they do it with bitcoin. This means that
        popular crypto currencies will always have a baseline value equivalent
        to the shadow economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, there are billions of people in the world who are unbanked (<a
          href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf"
          >estimated 31%</a
        >). Many of these people are either too rural to have easy access to a
        bank, or live in failed states where the bank is likely to steal their
        money. Many of these people also have smartphones (<a
          href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/"
          >about 83%</a
        >
        of the worldwide population, so maybe half of the unbanked population,
        though YMMV on this one). These people are
        <a
          href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/venezuelas-economy-regresses-crypto-fills-gaps-2021-06-22/"
          >already using popular crypto currencies to do otherwise legal
          work</a
        >, bypassing existing financial markets in their home countries.
        Obviously, this has economic value. Importantly, it has clean economic
        value, so we can't even ignore it by saying something like 'the
        government will regulate it away'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web3 is not only crypto currencies, but even if it was it would still
        justify some decent valuation.
      </p>
      <p><b>Yes, data on the chain is immutable. So what?</b></p>
      <p>
        In CS, an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object"
          >immutable object</a
        >
        is a piece of data that can't be changed after it is created. The only
        way to 'simulate' a change is to create a new piece of data with the
        changes that you want. Programmers love immutability. Immutable data is
        much easier to reason about in a program. It's significantly less
        likely to have bugs and it's much easier to debug. And, importantly for
        Web3, immutability is critical for decentralized applications. See
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM&ab_channel=InfoQ"
          >Rich Hickey</a
        >
        for more.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common complaint about Web3 is that once data is on a block chain,
        it's there forever. There is no way to delete things! There is no way
        to fix mistakes! Both of these complaints are, in a sense, true. They
        also totally miss the point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Erasers were invented in the late 1700s. Before that, it was pretty
        hard to make changes to existing documents. People wrote with ink and
        parchment. It was immutable. If a Roman merchant made a mistake in his
        books, he wouldn't erase the mistake, because he couldn't — instead, he
        would add a new transaction that fixed the problem. Modern accounting
        still more or less does this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memory works the same way. If my friend Martin moves and gets a new
        address, I don't magically forget the old one. A new piece of data is
        stored in my head. Then, when I want to visit Martin, I mentally pull
        up the most recent relevant address, call that one "Martin's house" and
        go there.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work with immutable systems all the time. We know how to build
        abstractions that hide immutability if we need to. And in many cases,
        tracking immutable data through a series of changes is incredibly
        helpful. We know it's helpful when we're debugging our code. When
        legislatures are settling property rights disputes, they are often
        doing the same thing by hand — of course immutability would be helpful
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Sometimes this argument is deployed against hype men who say 'we
        should put healthcare records on the blockchain'. In those cases, I am
        sympathetic. The answer, however, is to point out that sensitive data
        should never exist on the chain in the first place. Immutability is
        still good; arguing against immutability makes you look silly.)
      </p>
      <p><b>A few other hot takes</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A lot of people like to say that Web3 has been around for 10+ years
          and hasn't accomplished anything yet. Are these people blind?
          Examples above of how web3 is already being used. But also, most of
          the fascinating technological developments are really happening
          in/around ether, which launched in 2015. By comparison, Linux started
          in 1991, and it also took around 7-8 years before it started being
          picked up by super-computer users (and later, everyone else).
        </li>
        <li>
          There are lots of scams in the crypto space. Arguably, NFTs as a
          concept are a scam. The existence of scams is providing an excuse for
          otherwise smart people to avoid doing their homework. Do the
          homework. Web3 has interesting use cases, some of which I dive into
          below.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Closing thoughts</h6>
      <p>
        It's hard to find great pieces on why Web3 works, especially if you
        aren't already in the relevant spaces. A huge issue is that there is so
        much noise caused by the hype. That said, I think Vitalik Buterin (the
        founder and public face of Ethereum) has a
        <a href="https://vitalik.ca/index.html">pretty compelling blog</a>. I
        also recommend Karpathy's (head of AI @ Tesla)
        <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
          >From Scratch Tour of Bitcoin</a
        >
        for a very technical understanding of the problem. And, of course,
        there's the original
        <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">bitcoin whitepaper</a>, which
        I think is elegant, succinct, and intuitive.
