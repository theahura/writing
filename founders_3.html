    <h4>A Founder&#39;s Guide: Thoughts on Moats</h4>
    <h6>Written April, 2021. Published Aug, 2021.</h6>

    <div class="writing">
      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>
        This document acts as a journal entry of sorts, that describes Amol’s
        miscellaneous thoughts on moats and how startups can build and defend
        them. It also acts as a reference for the strategies that we can use to
        build moats that will be relevant for our company.
      </p>
      <h4>On Moats</h4>
      <p>
        Companies live and die based on their ability to carve out unique
        niches for themselves. The starting goal of every company is to become
        a monopoly in some small part of a massive market. Once the company is
        indispensable in one small area, the company is free to expand while
        always maintaining a foothold. The initial monopoly point can be
        incredibly small -- maybe the market is only 100 people -- but as long
        as the company is a monopoly in that space, it can thrive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why a monopoly? Because a monopoly means profit positivity. If you are
        the only person providing value in some key part of some tool chain,
        you can upcharge to generate profit that can then be reinvested to grow
        the business. That can mean expanding to new markets or shoring up the
        monopoly you have; either way, it’s good. See:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fx5Q8xGU8k"
          >competition is for losers.</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        A monopoly is defined by moats -- namely, the parts of your product or
        business model that prevent others from stealing your thunder. I tend
        to think of moats as ‘reasons people will use my product, even if
        someone else copies everything about it that is public’. Every startup
        needs to think at least a bit about what their moats are, how they can
        be strengthened, and how to build new ones. Once your moats are in
        place, you have a defensible position from which you can expand outward
        to exert influence and grow revenue.
      </p>

      <h6>Types of Moats</h6>
      <p>In the modern tech world, there are roughly four kinds of moats:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Technological improvements.</li>
        <li>Data storage.</li>
        <li>Network effects.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure moats.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We’ll cover each of these, why they matter, and how they can be
        implemented.
      </p>

      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/moat.png" width="400" />
        <p>
          I don't love the name 'moat'. Was 'competitive advantage' too many
          syllables?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Technological Improvement</h4>
      <p>
        Technological improvement moats are a catch-all that describe any kind
        of product or design improvement on some existing technology or problem
        space. Many startups start with tech moats, including virtually all
        startups coming out of academia. In many cases, this is fairly
        intuitive -- tech moats are directly tied to product, and relate
        closely to what founders believe is wrong with the world. The things
        that make you better than alternatives as a product are also the things
        that define your moat.
      </p>

      <p>
        The depth of the tech moat is therefore a direct function of how much
        better you are than alternatives. Alternatives doesn’t just have to be
        other comparable companies -- your tech moat depends on things that are
        substitutes as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, the tech moat is the weakest moat on the list. Unlike
        every other moat, a tech moat weakens with time and has inverse value
        with investment. In order to build a tech moat, a company must evaluate
        several possible products before deploying the one that actually works;
        competitors can copy the one that works directly, saving them on time
        and money. Further, anything that is public facing loses any stealth
        protections, resulting in copycats. It is possible to maintain a tech
        moat by hiding the secret sauce, but the nature of CS is such that most
        things will become open (or obsolete) sooner rather than later.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why at the start of a company, an effective tech moat must be
        at least 10x better than anything else on the market. A 10x improvement
        gives the company enough lead time to establish itself as a monopoly
        and drown out competitors. As a result, many startups that depend on
        tech moats come out of groundbreaking research in academia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ford is an excellent example of a tech moat. Ford’s method for
        manufacturing cars was so much better than everyone else that they
        essentially monopolized the automotive industry in the US for decades.
        Google is another, more recent example -- PageRank was so much better
        than whatever Yahoo was doing, that Google became the internet default
        within a year of founding. In both cases, the companies were able to
        utilize the initial boost generated by their tech moat to build
        stronger moats in other places.
      </p>

      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/moat-google.png" width="400" />
        <p>
          Did you know that if you search 'moat' on Google, almost all of the
          pictures are linked through tech articles about competitive
          advantages for Sillicon Valley componanies?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Data Storage</h4>
      <p>
        As the name would suggest, data storage moats are those that naturally
        arise out of a company storing data. Data storage moats can be broken
        down further into storage-as-a-product, storage-as-customization, and
        storage-as-fuel. These all function in different ways, but all depend
        on data storage in some form.
      </p>

      <h6>Storage as a Product</h6>
      <p>
        An object at rest stays at rest. When users upload data to a storage
        service, that data stays on that service. As a result, any service that
        offers personal data storage can craft a moat around the stickiness of
        user behavior when it comes to moving data between locations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data stickiness cuts both ways, however -- users are unlikely to upload
        data to a platform unless there is a significant compelling reason to
        do so. The worse the product, the less friction there needs to be to
        upload. This is why Google Photos automatically uploads from a user’s
        phone; the user never has to think about moving the data, it just
        happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        The storage product moat obviously scales depending on the amount of
        data a platform is storing. If a platform only has a few bits of
        information about a user, like name and address...well, that is a
        pretty weak moat. But if the platform has terabytes and terabytes of a
        user’s data, that user is basically never going to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dropbox is an excellent example of a storage product moat. Dropbox
        offers only 2GB of free space and in its modern incarnations is
        significantly worse in almost every way compared to Google Drive.
        However, I and many others still use Dropbox, because when it first
        came out it was the only game in town, and all of the data that I ever
        put on Dropbox is still there.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h6>Storage as Customization</h6>
      <p>
        Data storage isn’t just from user upload. Every time users interact
        with a platform, it can act as an opportunity to store data. Many of
        these interactions can be used for customization, which in turn makes
        the platform more attractive to the end user and creates a compelling
        moat on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever a user manipulates something on a platform, they feel a piece
        of ownership over the creation -- whether that be a slightly different
        ordering, or even just a name change. Some platforms allow intense
        customization, which in turn makes users feel intensely attached to the
        platform. Platforms that require specific skills to use have additional
        moat-qualities due to the nature of sunk cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, this all cuts both ways too. If a platform is hard to use
        without customization, it will be difficult to attract new users;
        conversely, the harder it is to use, the more likely our
        already-converted users will be users for life.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are dozens of great examples of this moat in action. Vim comes to
        mind -- vim is objectively a terrible text editor, but I can customize
        it to exactly what I need, which means I will never use anything else.
        Spotify is another compelling example of this moat. Even though Spotify
        generates value by streaming music, it retains users against copy-cats
        due to the stickiness of Spotify playlists.
        <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sean-parker-spotify-2010-10"
          >Once a user builds a playlist on Spotify, they won’t ever leave</a
        >. Tumblr is another good example where high levels of customization
        that people put into their blogs results in long term stickiness.
      </p>

            >my favorite stackoverflow question</a
          >.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h6>Storage as Fuel</h6>
      <p>
        Big data is seen as a moat in itself -- basically, storing user
        interactions as a means of generating datasets for training
        recommendation engines and the like. This is the weakest data storage
        moat, but it is surprisingly popular right now due to the hype around
        big tech and ML. While it is true that companies like Google are able
        to turn massive amounts of data into insights about user behavior, I
        think in practice this is basically a waste of time for any startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several companies that collect large amounts of data to
        explicitly sell to advertisers. These companies suck, and also
        immediately lose their moat the moment they sell the data, so it’s a
        wash.

      <h4>Network Effects</h4>
      <p>
        Network effect moats are those that are generated when a platform
        becomes better as more people use it. I model these moats as arising
        from any situation where ‘1 + 1 = 3’. The reason these exist as moats
        is fairly straightforward -- users gain additional benefits from being
        around other users on the platform, which in turn means that other
        companies need to build a product that is so much better that the
        network effects don’t matter. For the same reason, network effect moats
        are hard to build, especially when competing against someone else that
        is also trying to create (or has) network effects in the same space.
        Products that depend on network effects are terrible when they start.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two kinds of network effects: those with homogeneous users,
        and those with heterogeneous users.
      </p>

      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/networkeffects.jpg" width="400" />
        <p>Network effects.</p>
      </div>

      <h6>Homogeneous Networks</h6>
      <p>
        In a homogeneous network, every user is the same type of user. Each
        additional user that is added to the network is a unique net positive
        that drives growth for every additional user afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The canonical example of a homogeneous network moat is Facebook.
        Facebook benefits from each additional person who joins the social
        network. Even though Facebook objectively makes a terrible product,
        everyone has to be on facebook because everyone else is on Facebook. At
        this point, there is no possible product development that could
        possibly be strong enough to unseat Facebook; better products existed
        (G+, imo) but nothing was so good as to overcome the massive benefit
        Facebook gets from having everyone already on the platform. The only
        way to beat Facebook is to target new generations of users. Instagram,
        Snapchat, and TikTok actually tried this. Insta got bought, while Snap
        has to watch as its features get cannibalized by Insta. TikTok is alive
        and well, though Facebook is trying its hardest to cannibalize them
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        More generally, any social network has these kinds of network effects,
        including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Tinder.
      </p>

      <h6>Heterogeneous Networks</h6>
      <p>
        In a heterogeneous network, you have more than one kind of user.
        Generally, in these networks, the addition of a user of type A provides
        more value to users of type B, and vice versa.
      </p>

      <p>
        The canonical example of heterogeneous network moats is any kind of
        marketplace. Markets benefit from virtuous cycles in consumers and
        producers -- the more consumers there are, the more producers want to
        be there; and the more variety (and competition between) producers, the
        more consumers will show up. Netflix is an excellent example of a
        company that has managed to turn their heterogeneous network moat into
        a massive industry success (see
        <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/netflix-flexes/">Ben Thompson</a>
        for more).
      </p>
      <h4>Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>
        The last moat worth mentioning is the infrastructure moat -- moats
        generated by accrued capital or relationships that are just expensive
        and have a barrier to entry. In some ways, these are the OG moats.
        Manufacturers, railroads, telecommunications, and more are basically
        all protected by infrastructure moats. In the modern era,
        infrastructure moats can include patents and licenses. For example,
        Spotify and Netflix both have impressive infrastructure moats that come
        out of the licensing agreements they have with music/movie distributors
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amazon has perhaps the largest modern infrastructure moat. Their
        logistics operations (including physical holdings in the form of real
        estate, warehouses, trucks, and more) are absolutely incredible, and
        it’s propelled them to being a global juggernaut that is trying to eat
        the entire concept of commerce.
      </p>

        <p>
          In our next talk, we'll discuss common ways to get around moats, like
          trebuchets.
