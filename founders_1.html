    <h4>Founder&#39;s Guide: Intro</h4>
    <h6>June, 2020</h6>

    <div class="writing">
      <p>
        In February of 2021 I made the crazy and totally unadvisable decision
        to leave the comfortable world of Google and start a company. Easily
        the best decision I&#39;ve ever made. That said, if there is one thing
        I&#39;ve learned since then, it&#39;s that startups are
        <i>hard</i>. And also <i>weird</i>. Just like, very different from big
        tech.
      </p>

        <p>
          I recently learned that there is a
          <a href="https://pdxpetdesign.com/licki/">startup</a> making these,
          and every day I wonder what a day at that company looks like.
        </p>

      <p>
        Internally, I keep a journal of sorts that I&#39;ve taken to calling
        the Founder&#39;s Guide -- basically a place where my CEO and I can
        ramble about startups and how they work and how to think about them. A
        lot of what I write is retreading well known principles, but written in
        a way that makes it all click for me. I figure since I&#39;m already
        writing, I could take some of the more broadly applicable pieces and
        make them public. That&#39;s what this series is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I stand on the shoulders of giants. A lot of my thoughts on
        startups come from other folks who&#39;ve done it before (e.g.
        <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>) or people who are
        just way smarter than I am (e.g.
        <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson</a>). And I owe a
        shocking amount to random commenters on
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. If any of what
        I&#39;m going on about seems useful, those places probably have said it
        better than I ever could, and I recommend giving them a read.

          "We have to act like an animal thatâ€™s been cornered, acting
          erratically and blindly lashing out at anything around us." -- Erlich
          Bachman, Silicon Valley. Most of my thoughts comes from that show. I
          have not seen that show.
