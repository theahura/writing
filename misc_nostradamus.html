        I don't get asked to give talks that frequently, but when I do people
        generally want to hear my thoughts on ML/AI. I've come to expect
        questions like 'what is the state of the industry?', 'what should I be
        paying attention to for {hiring, planning, investment}?', and, my
        personal favorite, 'can you predict the future?'.
      </p>
      <p>
        (No one ever actually asks me to predict the future, but there are a
        bunch of questions of this sort that essentially require me to know
        what's going to happen, so I categorize these in the same bucket)
      </p>
      <p>
        I love when people ask me to predict the future, because I feel like I
        have license to just speculate wildly. The funny thing is, I'm not half
        bad at it, at least in the ML/AI space. About two years ago, at a talk
        I gave for Ubiquity, I made the following predictions:

        Man! Not to toot my own horn or anything but looking back from 2023 I
        was pretty on point! I'm personally especially proud of the prompt
        engineering prediction. Apparently companies are paying a ton of money
        now for prompt engineers:

        Though being actually good at prompt engineering seems about as easy as
        consistently predicting lottery numbers from tea leaves. Which, given
        that I have some expertise in doing something vaguely equivalent (as
        documented here), maybe they should send some of that cash my way
