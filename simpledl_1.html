        Modern deep learning is a weird place. We have these amazing tools that
        are constantly redefining what can be done with computers (go take a
        look at
        <a

        >
          AlphaFold</a
        >), but we basically have no idea how these things actually work.
        Clearly <i>someone</i> knows what they are doing, because surely we
        aren't driving all those cars on a hunch? (*cough*) But from the outside
        looking in, it's witchcraft.

          probably.

        After five years of actually working on this stuff, I think I've finally
        developed enough intuition to figure out how to actually do something
        interesting with this technology in a consistent way. And one of the
        first things I learned is that intuition is the cornerstone of modern
        deep learning practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think of ML scientists as the modern equivalent of Roman bridge
        builders. Humanity wouldn't figure out how to formalize bridge building
        until Newton came along...but the Romans still made some damn good
        bridges. The individual engineers all had these mental models of how
        bridge building worked, and that allowed them to innovate and optimize.
        Even though every model was wrong, some of those models were useful. You
        even see the same kind of rise and fall of 'architectures'. For years
        everyone builds
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapper_bridge"
          >Clapper bridges</a
        >, and then one day an engineer wakes up and goes 'Hey maybe
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_bridge">arches</a> would be
        better' and everyone starts doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Newton of deep learning will show up eventually, but it might take a
        few hundred years. In the meantime, we have to make due with intuition.
        Luckily, I think it's possible to build a pretty good mental model of
        deep ML models through practice. Yea, the first few times a model fails,
        it'll be a frustrating experience. But eventually you should be able to
        pattern match and generalize, doing a human form of gradient descent. In
        that sense, Deep learning is a bit like sculpture or photography --
        after a while, you get an eye for it.

        There are a lot of ML guides floating around out there, so let me start
        by saying what SimpleDL is <i>not</i>. It's not an implementation guide
        -- if I'm lucky I'll stay pretty far from actual code. It's not a dive
        into literature -- in a few places I might link to papers, and I might
        do a separate series on individual papers, but not here. It's not a
        highly rigorous mathematical approach to DL. It's not a history of ML.
        It's not a course on ML. It's definitely not a social commentary on ML.
      </p>
      <p>
        This series is, first and foremost, about building an intuition for deep
        learning. The goal is for the reader to come away with an instinct for
        sniffing out what a model is doing, and why, and how.
      </p>
      <p>
        This series is titled SimpleDL because I want to make things simple. But
        some familiarity with basic computing concepts will be helpful. If
        you've never touched a computer before, this series probably isn't for
        you. I'll be aiming for 'intermediate programmer, never worked in ML
        before' as my audience. That said, I think this will be most useful for
        folks who have maybe taken one or two classes on ML, and know some of
        the basic terms. If you know that a ML model has two modes, and that
        they are called training and inference, but you don't know much more
        beyond that, you're in the sweet spot.

        Before diving in, I want to highlight a few resources that really helped
        me get off the ground. First, the
        <a
          href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/"
        >
          Oxford ML Class by Nando de Freitas</a
        >. If you're interested in doing an actual course on this stuff, I think
        it's hard to beat this class. Second, the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfNandoDF">
          deep learning Youtube Videos</a
        >
        also by Nando de Freitas. Nando is an amazing lecturer, and I think he
        does an excellent job mixing theory and practice.

        Also, thanks for coming by to read some of the things I write! I hope
        it's useful/interesting. I don't know how frequently I'll update here,
        but when I do I'll post on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/theahura_">Twitter</a>.
