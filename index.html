    <h4>Simple DL Part 1: Introduction</h4>

    <div class="writing">
      <p>
        Modern deep learning is a weird place. We have these amazing tools that
        are constantly redefining what can be done with computers (go take a
        look at
        <a
          href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology"
        >
          AlphaFold</a
        >), and yet we don't have any way of describing how these things
        actually work. Clearly <i>someone</i> knows what they are doing, because
        surely we aren't driving all those cars on a hunch? (*cough*) But from
        the outside looking in, it's witchcraft.

        Or, well, it was to me when I got started. Deep learning is a bit like
        sculpture or photography -- after a while, you get an eye for it. I've
        been working with these things for five years or so, and I think I've
        finally developed enough intuition to figure out how to actually do
        something interesting with this technology in a consistent way. I like
        writing, and don't often make time to do it, so I figure a mini-series
        on how I think about deep learning models may be interesting to
        newcomers who are trying to wrap their head around the field.

        There are a lot of ML guides floating around out there, so let me start
        by saying what SimpleDL is <i>not</i>. It's not an implementation guide
        -- if I'm lucky I'll stay pretty far from actual code. It's not a dive
        into literature -- in a few places I might link to papers, and I might
        do a separate series on individual papers, but not here. It's not a
        highly rigorous mathematical approach to DL. It's not a history of ML.
        It's not a course on ML. It's definitely not a social commentary on ML.
      </p>
      <p>
        This series is, first and foremost, about building an intuition for deep
        learning. The goal is for the reader to come away with an instinct for
        sniffing out what a model is doing, and why, and how.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before diving in, I want to highlight a few resources that really helped
        me get off the ground. First, the
        <a
          href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/"
        >
          Oxford ML Class by Nando de Freitas</a
        >. If you're interested in doing an actual course on this stuff, I think
        it's hard to beat this class. Second, the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfNandoDF">
          Deep Learning Youtube Videos</a
        >
        also by Nando de Freitas. Nando is an amazing lecturer, and I think he
        does an excellent job mixing theory and practice.

        Also, thanks for coming by to read some of the things I write! I hope
        it's useful/interesting.
