    <h4>A Founder&#39;s Guide: Startups as Hypotheses</h4>
    <h6>Written March, 2020. Published June, 2020.</h6>

    <div class="writing">
      <h6>Objective</h6>
      <p>
        This document describes a framework for developing startups, in which
        the core business development is treated as a hypothesis that is
        subjected to a series of experiments designed to maximize the amount of
        confidence we have in that hypothesis. This document aims to provide a
        unifying philosophical grounding/justification for how we make business
        and strategy decisions while in early stages (pre-product market fit).
        This document is not intended to be a how-to guide. Rather, it is a
        form of early values adoption.
      </p>
      <h6>Scientific Method</h6>
      <p>It’s hard to know what to do next.</p>

      <p>
        Starting a company has a lot of variables, and almost all common
        failure modes essentially boil down to not having enough information or
        prioritizing the wrong information. Being rigorous and disciplined
        about company strategy is really important, but it can be hard to
        reason about what the optimal strategy should be.
      </p>

      <p>
        People have all sorts of fun metaphors that help them reason about
        startups. Things like ‘startups are a bet on the future paid with time
        and effort’ or ‘early stage startups are like hunting in prehistoric
        times’ or something else. My personal favorite is: ‘startups are a
        hypothesis’. I like this framing because it invokes the scientific
        method. We were all taught this in school, hopefully, but just as a
        recap: the core purpose of the scientific method is to eliminate biases
        and perform data driven iteration towards a better understanding of the
        world. This is done through the construction (pre-registration) of a
        hypothesis -- defined as a proposed explanation for an observed
        phenomenon. The hypothesis is then validated (or disproved) through an
        experiment that is specifically designed to gather expository evidence
        for the claim. Ideally, the experiment is designed such that the only
        possible explanation for the results proves or disproves the
        hypothesis.

      <h6>Hypotheses Testing</h6>
      <p>
        Every company has, at its core, a hypothesis about markets -- namely,
        that the markets behave in a certain way X, and based on that limited
        information we believe Y that justifies the existence of our product.
        This core hypothesis can then spin out into sub-hypotheses that relate
        to product areas, individual products, and even product features.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hypothesis is not valuable in itself. The information that comes out
        of testing a hypothesis against the world is valuable. In order to
        thrive, the company must validate every hypothesis in the chain using
        data driven experiments. And they must throw out the hypotheses that
        don’t align with the real world. Many startups die because they build
        something the market doesn’t want or need. This speaks to a lack of
        appropriate hypothesis testing, or an unwillingness to read the writing
        on the wall and potentially let go of an individual ‘creative vision’.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the early stages of a startup, the goal is to find product market
        fit. I think of this as ‘create hypotheses about the world, run
        experiments, and discard your hypotheses until one of them proves
        true’. A popular phrase in the startup world is ‘fail fast and fail
        often’. This naturally relates to the hypothesis framework of startups.
        There is no value in pursuing a hypothesis for its own sake. A startup
        should be willing -- eager, even -- to discover evidence that the
        hypothesis they are pursuing is flawed, and they should do so as
        quickly as possible to minimize time. Fail fast. And after failing, the
        startup should pivot, try a new experiment, and go again. Fail often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failure here is a strange word, because whenever a startup has
        disproven a hypothesis and moved on, they have actually avoided the
        only failure that matters: pursuing dead ends.
      </p>
      <h6>Experiments</h6>
      <p>
        Crafting a good experiment is highly dependent on the hypothesis being
        tested. In general, however, a good experiment will have some or all of
        the following traits:
      </p>

      <p>The experiment...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          is directly based on user feedback or user behavior in some way.
        </li>
        <li>
          has clear quantifiable metrics involved, so that it is easy to
          determine whether something failed or succeeded (prevents bias).
        </li>
        <li>
          has few possible reasons for success or failure besides the
          hypothesis in question.
        </li>
        <li>is repeatable with different cohorts of people.</li>
        <li>generates a lot of useful information about the world.</li>
        <li>is cheap to run.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Hypothesis Testing and Company Lifecycle</h6>
      <p>
        Hypothesis testing should occur at every stage of the company life
        cycle, with each experiment feeding into the next in the pipeline, and
        with each subsequent experiment becoming more expensive and requiring
        more commitment to run. At any point if an experiment fails, the
        hypothesis needs to be refined and backtracked.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is best illustrated through an example. Jake wants to found a
        social media for dogs. His hypothesis is, roughly speaking, ‘People who
        are pet owners love their dogs, and love to meet other people who love
        dogs, so there is an unmet need for a dog-based social media’.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First he runs the most basic experiment: does he personally think
          this company will be successful? This is also the cheapest experiment
          to run, with no additional commitment. Jake asks himself, and answers
          in the affirmative. Cost: ten minutes, $0.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, Jake sets out to determine whether people in his network who
          are dog owners would use this platform. He puts together a survey and
          asks a bunch of friends who are pet owners. They all answer in the
          affirmative. Cost: 1h, $0.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jake then gets someone on upwork to generate 300 email addresses of
          dog owners, and sends out an email campaign to get further
          validation. For each person who responds, he does a one hour
          interview to get a sense of their market need for this product. Cost:
          10h, $50-100.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jake is pretty confident of the external market need now, so he
          starts building a product. This may require expertise outside his
          current skillset, so he may have to hire someone to build a rough
          prototype. The prototype itself consists of many sub-hypotheses,
          including specific features and designs. He puts the prototype on the
          web and measures user engagement through surveys and trackers. Cost:
          30h, $1000.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users don’t seem that engaged -- it turns out that even though they
          said they like meeting dog owners, in practice the messaging/IM
          features get no traction. Instead, users engage heavily with pictures
          of dogs. Jake formulates a new product hypothesis -- a very minimal
          ‘stream pictures of uploaded dogs only’ -- and builds and releases a
          new prototype. Cost: 30h, $1000.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users really enjoy this product. Feedback indicates demand for a cat
          specific spin-off. In order to run this experiment, Jake needs to
          scale the company up. He hires a full team to continue adding new
          features and maintain infrastructure. Cost: fulltime, $100k.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Etc. etc. It is easy to see how these individual experiments allow Jake
        to battle test what he is working on, to fail fast and fail often, and
        to make calculated proximal hypotheses based on information. At each
        step, if Jake got a negative result, he could go to the step previous
        and tweak the hypothesis with the new information about the world that
        he discovered. With a significant amount of repetition, Jake will
        eventually hit on something that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, at each step the goal is to test something highly specific
        and get meaningful feedback on whether or not something works or fails.
        We should try to do the least amount of work to fail -- ask yourself,
        ask your team, ask your users (if you have users to burn), ask the
        market (if this is available/accessible), and then build.
      </p>
      <h6>Tangent: Experiments and Raising, Hiring</h6>
      <p>
        Startups often wonder when to raise funds. As evidenced above,
        experiments rarely have the same cost. Testing a new feature-hypothesis
        will be significantly less expensive than testing a new
        product-hypothesis. Experiments farther down the line will require
        additional funding. Eventually, the next obvious experiment in the
        chain will cost more than the resources available. This is when to
        raise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Startups often wonder when to hire. The answer is the same. When you
        have an experiment that you want to run, but don’t have the manpower or
        skills to run it, you hire.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice you probably need to plan at least 6mo in advance for both
        of these, but if your experiments are good and following a trend line
        you should be able to predict when you need these resources before you
        need them.
