        Web3 is the new polarizing thing. Everyone has opinions about it — it
        feels like everyone has to have opinions about it — and so lots of
        people are saying lots of things and most of it is noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not a Web3 enthusiast. Full disclosure, I have about 10-15k
        invested in eth, most of that coming from an investment I made back in
        2017. I tend to swing back and forth between bearish and bullish on the
        overall idea. I have some very smart friends who I respect deeply on
        both sides of Web3, so I guess it makes sense that I would end up being
        more or less neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        But man. People on every side of this thing are just spouting insane
        bullshit! Enough that I wanted to write down my own opinions, so that I
        can keep some sense of what's real and what isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        One caveat before diving in: I don't <i>think</i> any of the takes
        below are straw men, but I'm happy to be proven wrong and will
        update/issue corrections as needed.

      <h6>Part 3: What do I think?</h6>
      <p>
        Before diving into my thoughts on Web3, let me tell you a story about
        the history of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first versions of the internet, back in the 60s through the 80s,
        had little to no standardization. Computers physically connected to
        other computers via ethernet cables, mostly on small private networks
        maintained by universities, companies, or other organizations. In order
        for the computers to talk to each other, they had to know how to parse
        incoming data. This mostly wasn't a problem, however, because each
        organization could mandate top-down how computers would communicate. I
        call this web1. Web1 is characterized by being bespoke at every level.
        Data storage, data transfer, and data processing were all customized,
        and therefore not interoperable.'
      </p>
      <p>
        A few smart people realized that standardizing internet infrastructure
        would massively increase the scope and scale of the internet. These
        folks started developing transfer protocols, and tools that could
        automatically parse data presented using those transfer protocols. The
        most popular of these protocols was HTTP, first proposed in 1989, which
        rapidly became the only game in town thanks to intense network effects.
        The mass adoption of HTTP ushered in the era of Web2. Web2 is
        characterized by having a common language — in this case, a shared
        information protocol — but having isolated data storage and bespoke
        data processing. Most of the web that we interact with today, including
        Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc, are set up in this image.
        Unfortunately, this setup isn't ideal for the end consumer. The problem
        with Web2 is that the data is intrinsically tied with the application.
        If Google were to shut down one of their services, like <s>Answers</s>
        <s>Buzz</s> <s>Code Search</s> <s>Talk Reader</s> <s>Orkut</s>
        <s>Picasa</s> <s>Map Maker</s> <s>Spaces</s> <s>G+</s> Youtube, all of
        the Youtube video data that Google had collected over the years would
        be gone too. Even if Google open sourced the data itself, it wouldn't
        matter without the tools to run applications that process the data. So
        Google is now a single point of failure. (Never mind that this is
        obviously great for Google)
      </p>
      <p>
        A few smart people realized that decentralized data had some pretty
        important advantages over the Web2 model. It was more resilient to
        removals or censorship; it opened the possibility for sustainably
        transferring large amounts of data; it allowed interoperability beyond
        the protocol level. A decade after HTTP, Napster (and later,
        BitTorrent) came into existence. In a world where artificial scarcity
        was being enforced by parasitic middle men, these new technologies
        promised a global revolution in how we thought about computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        That revolution didn't happen. A decentralized file system requires an
        initial host (a seeder) who can share data with many other recipients.
        Ideally, the recipients stay on the network and continue to share,
        providing more seeders until the entire network has all the necessary
        data. In practice, individual users have no incentive to continue
        participating in the network once they have their data. In other words,
        decentralized file transfers fail because they depend on charity. Every
        torrent eventually goes dark because there is no one left to seed. And
        you can't build infrastructure (or a company) on top of data that
        eventually disappears.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like this story, even though it's not quite correct. Most of the
        motivations of the actors involved were not as neatly packaged as I
        presented them. But it's a nice narrative, and it fits well with the
        underlying technological trends. And it sets up how I think about Web3.
      </p>
      <h6>So, Web3</h6>
      <p>
        I think most of the current talk about Web3 is bullshit, spread by
        people who have a weak understanding of the central technology, people
        who are motivated by individual applications at best, and in-group
        validation/social signaling at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
        I set out to understand what building blocks Web3 provides, and why
        these are unique or valuable compared to other existing technologies.
        And after talking to a lot of people and reading a bunch of papers, I
        came away with three things.
      </p>
      <p>Web3 offers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A mechanism for storing public state, coupled with robust permissions
          for managing that state.
        </li>
        <li>
          A financial incentive to make that state publicly available for
          everyone, always.
        </li>
        <li>
          A mechanism for splitting ownership of state into arbitrarily small
          pieces.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think these three pieces have unique value only when bundled
        together. Any one of these pieces alone would be near useless. To
        understand why, it's helpful to think about how Web3 differs from
        torrents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Web3 world, all data is hosted on the same chain. The big tech
        titans of Web3 are using the same decentralized data store as every
        small mom-n-pop application out there. That means that as long as
        someone somewhere wants to use the chain, all other applications on the
        chain survive. In the language of torrents, every new torrent seeds all
        previous torrents; this means that as long as someone is seeding some
        torrent, all previously existing torrents will continue to seed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why would anyone host data that isn't theirs? In Web3 world, you
        get paid to do so. Every crypto miner doubles as a validator and host
        of the underlying data. The more folks using Web3, the more money
        miners make; so miners themselves are incentivized to keep all Web3
        data public all the time. This is like getting paid for seeding. Some
        miners will make this more explicit by also offering Web2 compatible
        APIs that other services can pay to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Web3 needs to be a closed loop, so you can't pay miners in fiat
        currencies — otherwise someone would have to provide an external source
        of capital, and would have outsize control over the public data.
        Instead, miners get paid in tokens that constitute ownership shares.
        Those ownership shares determine who is allowed to edit which data. The
        more you have, the more you can make changes (I'm glossing over some
        technically complex ideas here, but this is the basic gist of Proof of
        Stake and, to an extent, Proof of Work). If the data on a chain is
        valuable, the right to modify it is also valuable. This is sufficient
        incentive for miners in the closed ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the technology for public databases have been around
        forever, the incentives weren't there, which made all previous public
        databases unusable. By contrast, I think Web3 provides a complete
        implementation of an actually usable, globally persistent public
        database. This is a unique engineering primitive, a technical building
        block that can be used for many other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        One application — the one we're most familiar with — is crypto
        currencies. Even though crypto currencies have many problems, they
        clearly provide unique economic value (banking the unbanked,
        circumventing failed states, or enabling illegal transactions). Their
        value comes from the fact that no one government can effectively shut
        down the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        A much more fascinating application is
        <a href="https://twitter.com/darkforest_eth?lang=en">Dark Forest</a>, a
        MMO-RTS built on Ethereum. I'd argue that there was no meaningful
        reason Dark Forest had to have public data, but because all player data
        was on the chain, random players could create their own clients for the
        game without having to interact with, or even know about, the core
        gameplay code. <i>While they were playing it</i>. People even developed
        unique modules (e.g. a bounty system) that meaningfully changed
        gameplay, without any interaction from the core devs at all. Obviously,
        I think this is cool. But more importantly, I don't see how this
        happens in Web2. In a more general sense, developers in the Web2 world
        share code, but not infrastructure. Developers in the Web3 world share
        both, always. This means rapid change and constant deployment,
        resulting in more interesting and better applications. (Importantly,
        this isn't always good for the original developer!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I do think there is a real ideological value in decentralized
        data. Companies should not be able to take the data we created with
        them when they disappear. Other people should be allowed to pick up
        where they left off. Only a useful idiot thinks Web3 'cannot be
        centralized' (they may be employed by Metamask or OpenSea). Everyone
        who's paying attention to the space knows that OpenSea is highly
        centralized and effectively dominates the NFT marketplace, but also
        (hopefully knows) that's not the point. The point is, OpenSea cannot
        control the data by fiat. If OpenSea the application stops being the
        best existing tool, people will leave their platform; consumers aren't
        bound to a platform because of sunk costs. And if OpenSea the company
        stops operating, a new marketplace will pop up without any data loss.
        Essentially, OpenSea has made a promise to their users that they cannot
        build a company off a data-moat alone. This kind of promise is
        impossible to make in Web2. (I think this points to an interesting
        sociological effect: if public data is the norm, companies have to make
        their data public, else no one would trust them).
      </p>
      <p>
        So far I've spoken a lot about why I think Web3 is interesting and, in
        some cases, valuable. But engineering is about tradeoffs; it's not at
        all obvious that the benefits of Web3 outweigh the costs. And there are
        meaningful engineering costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decentralized data stores have few consistency guarantees, so any
        applications that require near-real-time read-write consistency have to
        be pretty clever about how they interact with any blockchains. Further,
        because code is run publicly, there is a significant increase in attack
        surface that needs to be accounted for. These costs are immediately
        felt by developers, while many of the benefits of public data are
        hypothetical and for the consumer in the long term. As a career SWE,
        most things I've built or seen or even heard of would be much harder to
        implement in Web3, with questionable short-term benefit for the end
        user. Frankly, most things I've seen on Web3 were harder to build on
        Web3. There just aren't enough abstractions between a dev and the data
        store yet to really make that process easy. I suspect that improvements
        in the underlying technology will mitigate these issues eventually, but
        I have no idea what the timeline might look like.
      </p>
      <p>There are meaningful social costs as well.</p>
      <p>
        The mining-model that supports the Web3 ecosystem is computationally
        expensive, requiring a constantly increasing need for power. The
        increase in demand for power has led to more investment in renewables —
        many crypto miners are located near hydro, for example. But cheap power
        is cheap power, regardless of whether it comes from the sun or from
        dead dinosaurs. Miners in poorer countries commonly use coal to fuel
        their crypto mining rigs, causing a ton of environmental damage.
        Supposedly the energy is being used to power transactions, but it's an
        artificial constraint set by the limits of Web3. If you aren't a
        believer in Web3 tech, the energy consumption is just another slap to
        the face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, tying monetary gain to computational cycles has created a
        ton of perverse incentives. Hidden crypto miners in the browser have
        become a popular way of sucking up energy from unwitting consumers.
        Many cloud companies struggle to provide free tiers that aren't
        immediately abused by automated crypto bots. Providing a cheap and
        anonymous way of facilitating illegal transactions is obviously
        socially harmful — crypto currencies in particular have resulted in a
        significant increase in ransomware attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        These costs are externalized. No part of the Web3 ecosystem has tools
        to handle these failure modes; they exist outside the Web3 view of the
        world. These costs have to be considered when the technology is being
        adopted. After all, once you adopt a decentralized technology, you
        can't easily put it back.
      </p>

      <h6>Closing thoughts</h6>
      <p>
        So overall, I'm neutral on Web3. I'm interested in learning more, and
        seeing where it goes. Probably I will continue my cycle of being
        bearish one month and bullish the next. I think the best thing for the
        Web3 community would be for the current hype train to stop, for the
        speculative bubble burst catastrophically. That will clean out everyone
        who is polluting the conversation with dollar signs, allowing the
        developers with a true passion for the space to continue building.
