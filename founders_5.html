    <h4>A Founder&#39;s Guide: Google from the Outside</h4>
    <h6>Written Jan, 2022. Published Feb, 2022.</h6>

      <p>
        About a year ago, I left Google Research to start my own company. I
        left mostly for personal reasons, but of course some amount of big-tech
        fatigue (amplified by COVID burnout) played a role. I even wrote a 'Why
        I Left Google' post — an evergreen genre of blog post, if there ever
        was one — though I never published it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I've had a lot of time to reflect on my career there.
        Actually, that's not quite right. I've had a lot of time to ruthlessly
        steal as much of Google's people-ops and culture as possible. Why?
        Well, yes, there are undoubtedly countless examples of things that
        Google gets things wrong, but it was only when I had to run my own
        company with my own team that I understood the strength of Google's
        operational structure and the things it gets right.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few things that I think are maybe not obvious to anyone who
        hasn't run an organization.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communication is <i>really really really</i> hard.</li>
        <li>
          Incentivizing collaboration/forward progress is
          <i>really really really</i> hard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Onboarding new folks is…well, it's moderately hard. But worth
          mentioning!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While I was at Google, I spent a lot of time trying to understand the
        internal dynamics of the company. What makes a trillion dollar behemoth
        with the population of a small country functional? With a year of
        hindsight, I think Google really nails these three areas of
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I have to preface everything that follows with an important
        caveat. The number one reason for Google's success is that it stumbled
        upon the singular business model that successfully monetized the web.
        Not OKRs. Not foosball. Not free food. But Google chose to point that
        money hose towards organizational efficiency, and did learn a few
        things. This is an attempt to catalog what succeeded.
      </p>

      <p>
        I split this up into three subsections, one for each challenge area
        above. The first is about
        <a href="./founders_5a.html">communication at Google</a>. The second is
        about <a href="./founders_5b.html">collaboration at Google</a>. The
        third is about onboarding at Google (WIP).
