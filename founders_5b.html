    <h4>A Founder&#39;s Guide: Collaboration at Google</h4>
    <h6>Written Feb, 2022. Published March, 2022.</h6>
    <div class="writing">
      <p>
        Collaboration is "the action of working with someone to produce or
        create something". This is a surprisingly nuanced definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, collaboration is an "action". It's not something that happens
        passively, it is something that requires an actual change from the
        default, which in turn implies thought and planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, collaboration involves "working with someone". The word 'with'
        has a lot of definitions, it's something you probably don't ever even
        think about because it's so common but Google says there are 10 unique
        definitions for the word. The most relevant is 'in the same direction
        as'. You are working 'in the same direction as' someone else. This
        implies alignment — of goals, values, techniques. You cannot
        collaborate without being aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally, collaboration requires the 'production or creation' of
        something. You don't collaborate in a vacuum. Collaboration has an end
        state, a goal in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaboration, at some level, is baked into the DNA of every company.
        You start a company — and hire other people and so on — because it's
        more efficient than working on your own. But collaboration is really
        fucking hard. Raise your hand if you've heard this story: a bunch of
        people get together to do a thing, everyone works on their own version
        of the idea until there's overlap and clash, nothing is agreed upon and
        the group falls apart without accomplishing anything. You know what's
        not hard? For people who are nominally collaborating to actually be
        working in isolated silos.
      </p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/cowtools.png" width="300" />
        <p>The joke writes itself.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Why does this happen? Well, first, because collaboration depends on
        communication, and we
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_5a.html"
          >already discussed how painful that is</a
        >. But also, people can't read minds. Even the best intentioned
        developers cannot fully understand what another developer is doing
        without collaborating in some way. Software is just too complex, too
        abstract. So if there isn't a serious attempt to regularly sync on some
        mutual understanding, people diverge until you one day realize none of
        the pieces are actually compatible.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's in the best case. In practice, many developers don't like
        collaborating. We all have our own styles of programming, our own way
        of doing things. Programming is an expression of thought, and trying to
        get into the thought process of another person is frustrating and time
        consuming and, frankly, sometimes irrationally deeply upsetting (see:
        tabs and spacing, single vs double quotes, 80ch line limits…). So
        developers naturally isolate themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a managerial and organizational perspective, this is bad.
        Isolation means bottlenecks. It means dependencies on individual people
        or teams. And most importantly, it slows down development
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_4.html">corkscrews</a>
        — if you aren't collaborating, you have no reason to make your code
        readable or usable for more general use cases. But you can't force
        people to collaborate, not really, because collaboration happens at
        every level of the company, from hundred person orgs all the way down
        to individuals, during public all hands and 'in the gaps' when no one
        is looking. So you have to instead make collaboration something that is
        worthwhile, such that every person is naturally incentivized to
        collaborate by default.
      </p>
      <h6>At Google...</h6>
      <p>
        At Google, collaboration was mostly the default. I've already written
        about
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_5a.html"
          >Google's efforts to make communication seamless</a
        >. I think Google took that foundation and did a great job setting up
        systems that would encourage people to seek out others and work
        together. For the most part, these systems functioned by implicitly or
        explicitly tying collaboration to personal achievement metrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, before going further, I have to note that many even of these
        systems felt frustrating for many developers. The organizational tools
        below are often maligned for being stressful and difficult and
        unenjoyable and inefficient. I'm not surprised. Collaboration is hard,
        and often uncomfortable, so managerial levers that encourage
        collaboration are looked upon with distrust and skepticism.
        Nonetheless, I think the net effect was overwhelmingly positive for
        Google's forward mobility.
      </p>
      <p>With that out of the way, let's talk about why perf is great.</p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/pitchforks.jpg" width="600" />
      </div>
      <i>Perf and Peer Review</i>
      <p>
        For those of you who have luckily avoided being within earshot of a
        Googler in February, March, August, or September, Perf is shorthand for
        Performance Review. It is a bi-annual (meaning twice a year) review
        period of about a month, where engineers are asked to write somewhere
        between 1000 and 5000 words on what they did and how awesome they are.
        Perf is used as the primary input for calculating bonuses and,
        eventually, promotions. And since every promotion relies on all past
        Perf results, there is a strong incentive to write a 'good' Perf every
        cycle.
      </p>
      <p>This is very stressful.</p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/perf.png" width="300" />
      </div>
      <p>
        But I'm not here to talk about stress, I'm here to talk about a key
        aspect of Perf: the peer review. See, in order to have a 'good' Perf,
        you need to solicit short and long form reviews from peers. This
        feedback is heavily counted when evaluating an employee's trajectory.
        Importantly, reviews from high-level folks outside your team are
        weighted higher than internal reviews — if your director thinks you're
        great, that's whatever, but if a different director thinks you're
        great, that's a big fucking deal. This is especially true as you go up
        the promotion ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, this system inventivizes anyone who wants a good Perf (i.e.
        everyone) to constantly think about how they can interact with and
        provide value to other people on other teams. That in turn encourages
        good API design, clear documentation, and generalized multi-purpose
        tooling (see
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_4.html"
          >corkscrew development</a
        >). Critically, this works both ways. If I help you, we both can give
        each other strong peer reviews. So we end up having a very good reason
        to align on goals and strategy, and an equally good reason to develop a
        process that is legible -- enough that we could write about it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peer review happens at every level of the command hierarchy at Google.
        As a result, there is an organic bottom-up drive to work across teams
        and orgs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe not coincidentally, teams that promoted candidates without strong
        peer reviews were, in my experience, harder to work with. They were
        also much more likely to be re-orged or disbanded.
      </p>
      <i>Impact metrics</i>
      <p>
        Any conversation about Perf requires mentioning 'impact'. At Google,
        'impact' is a catch-all term that means 'how much did my work change
        the company'. Most of the time, impact is measured in dollars. But it
        can also be measured in clicks, or latency, or engagement time. Broadly
        speaking, the more impact, the more likely you are to get promoted. So
        people cared a lot about impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know what else counts as impact? Speeding up your coworkers. If you
        can make some task faster for your peers, you can claim impact — and
        get credit for some of the downstream impact that they showed. When I
        was at Google, the joke was that if you wanted a fast promotion, you
        should go work on internal infra (like
        <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>). It's easy
        to rack up impact when every code change touches every engineer at the
        company. But Google isn't stingy, even good tutorials count as impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        This accounting system turns every engineer into a devops person. In
        practice, I think this policy really helps smooth things out on the
        margins. Every time an eng builds a handy bash tool, or works through
        some tricky configuration, they might spend the extra day to write and
        publicize some good docs on what they did and why. The usual
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_4.html">corkscrews</a>
        apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, these sorts of libraries or utilities are win-win. Everyone
        is looking for impact. Since speeding up other people genuinely helps
        them achieve more, there is strong incentive to seek out and re-use
        tools other people build. So for any given utility, the developer wants
        as many people as possible to use it; and anyone who can benefit is
        already seeking it out.
      </p>
      <i>Peer Bonuses</i>
      <p>
        The last piece worth highlighting in Google's arsenal of incentives is
        the peer bonus program. A peer bonus is a $200 bonus on your paycheck.
        Every Google employee is given five peer bonuses that they can hand out
        each quarter. You can't give them to anyone in your direct management
        chain, nor anyone who's given you a peer bonus that same quarter. They
        don't roll over, and you don't benefit from keeping them, so there's no
        reason not to use them. Generally, the recipient's manager is alerted
        and everyone on their team reaches out to congratulate.
      </p>
      <p>Peer bonuses are amazing.</p>
      <p>
        Peer bonuses are a great way to encourage folks to go the extra mile.
        They are a natural, decentralized mechanism that rewards kindness and
        helpfulness. And receiving a peer bonus really does make you feel like
        a million bucks, even if the actual change to your paycheck is minimal.
        I think peer bonuses send a strong cultural signal about what is
        important from top down, in a way that really impacts engineering
        behavior in all the subtle ways that are necessary for a good
        collaborative environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        (O, and peer bonuses are a great way to rapidly identify who on a team
        is carrying the weight or providing a lot of value.)
      </p>
      <h6>Closing thoughts</h6>
      <p>
        This ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would be, but I
        think that's because it is hard to incentivize collaboration. But it's
        also an incredibly critical thing to manage, whether you're building a
        startup or any other kind of organization. It's an active process, and
        therefore requires active attention and explicit supporting policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google has 100k employees. Yes, there are conflicts, and yes, teams
        aren't always on the same wavelength. But I worked with folks from
        every part of Google — from Photos to Robotics to Ads to YouTube to
        Health — and because every person I met was incentivized to collaborate
        we were able to accomplish some pretty awesome things. I don't think
        they were doing anything special, though, and the policies they put in
        place are easy to copy. Once you nail it down, you can easily 100x your
        organization's productivity.
