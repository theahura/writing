      <h6>Overview</h6>
      <p>
        At this point, you hopefully have a high level understanding of some key
        deep learning principles: features, embeddings, losses, and how they all
        interact with each other. Unfortunately for me, some of my readers
        complained that this was hardly enough. Without walking through an end
        to end example that showed how the intuition could be applied, this
        whole project was meaningless. <b>sigh</b>. Even though I was really
        hoping to avoid digging into the specifics of a deep learning library,
        my readers are probably right.
