      <h6>Overview</h6>
      <p>
        At this point, you hopefully have a high level understanding of some key
        deep learning principles: features, embeddings, losses, and how they all
        interact with each other. Unfortunately for me, some of my readers
        complained that this was not enough, and that without an end to end
        example that showed how the intuition could be applied, this whole
        project was meaningless. <b>sigh</b>. Even though I was really hoping to
        avoid digging into the specifics of a deep learning library, I think my
        readers are probably right.
      </p>

        for deep learning. Most of these implement a small neural network that
        can learn to classify handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 (aka
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST</a>). Many
        of these tutorials are quite good for understanding the particular
        syntax of a specific library, but they do a poor job of linking the code
        to some deeper understanding of ML. In part that is because the deeper
        understanding doesn't really exist -- the answer to 'why' is 'because'.

        <p>
          I wish I could say that this frustration goes away. It doesn't. I
          still feel like this when I read new ML papers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this tutorial, I'll instead do something totally different by
        teaching you how to implement a small neural network that can learn to
        classify handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. We're not going to touch code
        until the very end -- instead, we'll spend a lot of time trying to think
        through the problem in order to build some intuition of what we should
        be doing. All parts of the tutorial will be grounded in the previous
        SimpleDL lessons. Even though MNIST is a really well known dataset with
        countless 'solutions', I'll try to approach the task as if it was a real
        world learning problem.

      <h6>The Problem</h6>
      <p>
        You work for the IRS. You have to deal with millions of tax filings --
        over 150M, according to a random website called Google. That's a ton of
        filings. Most people do these on printed forms, filling in fields by
        hand. The techs over at the Department of Technology have scanned all
        the filings. Now they need to pull out all of the numbers.
      </p>
      <p>One problem: the scans are all unparsed images.</p>
      <p>
        We need to build a system that can convert images of numbers into actual
        numbers in some programming language or database, so that we can do more
        number crunching down the line. Unfortunately, there are tons of edge
        cases, which makes most statistical/geometric/traditional computer
        vision approaches obsolete. A human can probably figure out most of
        them, but humans are expensive and slow. Can we use deep learning?
