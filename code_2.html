    <h4>Programming: Simplicity in Prototypes</h4>
    <h6>March, 2022</h6>

    <div class="writing">
      <h6>Prelude: add10</h6>
      <p>
        Here is a deceptively simple question. Let's say I have the following
        code:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">x = 5

def add10():
  return x + 10

print(add10())</code></pre>
      <p>What does add10() return?</p>
      <p>
        One could make a case that <code>add10()</code> returns 15, but they
        would be wrong. A more cynical person might (rightfully) point out that
        <code>add10()</code> is dependent on x, so we can only answer the
        question if we know what <code>x</code> is. Closer, but I didn't ask
        what <code>add10()</code> returns for a given value of <code>x</code>.
        I asked what does <code>add10()</code> return?
      </p>
      <p>
        I would argue that we can never know what this function returns. The
        best that we can do is know what this function returns at a specific
        time. x can change, and with it so will our function.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, in the middle of your code, you encounter a line of code like
        <code>value = add10()</code>, you're now in stateful hell. Enjoy
        backtracking through the code to try and figure out what
        <code>value</code> is.
      </p>
      <h6>Simplicity</h6>
      <p>
        I recently stumbled upon Rich Hickey's 2011 talk,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4"
          >Simple Made Easy</a
        >. Rich has a 30 year SWE career and is known as the creator of
        Clojure, a lisp dialect built on top of the JVM. He's been around the
        block. In the talk, Rich defines simplicity as 'the property of being
        un-entangled. Simplicity is the opposite of complexity – therefore, a
        complex thing is highly entangled.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does 'entangled' mean? Most obviously, entanglement describes
        things that are joined together in some way. But I prefer a slightly
        more subtle definition:
        <i
          >things that are entangled cannot be understood separately from the
          whole</i
        >. So a complex thing has a lot of pieces that cannot be separately
        understood. A set of simple things, by contrast, are as easy to
        understand separately as they are together.
      </p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/plaiting.png" width="400" />
      </div>

      <p>Let's get the basics out of the way. This code:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">x = 5

def add10():
  return x + 10

print(add10())</code></pre>
      <p>
        is complex. It is complex because the function <code>add10()</code> is
        entangled with the value of <code>x</code>. More than that, every
        single thing that touches <code>x</code> is entangled with every other
        thing that touches <code>x</code>, in a combinatorial way. You cannot
        know the value of <code>add10</code> unless you know what previous code
        was run and how that impacted the value of <code>x</code>.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">def add10():
  return x + 10

def append10():
  x = [x]
  return x.append(10)

def update10():
  x = {x}
  x.update(10)
</code></pre>
      <p>
        If you run <code>add10()</code> and get a type error from the code
        above, a) you deserve it, and b) debugging is going to be very hard. I
        can stare at the definition of <code>add10()</code> all I want, but I
        won't be able to find the source of the type error unless I understand
        the code as a whole. If your codebase is larger than 200 lines, this
        absolutely sucks.
      </p>
      <h6>Why Do People Entangle?</h6>
      <p>
        Hopefully everyone will agree that building anything long term and
        sustainable in the environment above is difficult. But people do things
        like this all the time. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it's easy. Not in the sense that it's easy to understand – we
        just laid out above that this kind of entanglement is anything but easy
        to understand. Rather, it's easy to write. You need to store a new
        piece of state? Great, just throw it at the top of your file (in global
        scope), and now you know that every other part of your code has access
        to it. No need to keep track of pesky function parameters, or threading
        variables between different areas of your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example. Imagine you're trying to add a new hit()
        function to our blackjack game below. Which is easier to write?
      </p>
      <div
        style="
          display: grid;
          grid-template-columns: 400px 400px;
          grid-gap: 5px;
        "
      >
        <div>
          <pre><code class="language-python">deck = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
hand = []

def deal():
  hand.append(deck.pop())
  hand.append(deck.pop())
  
def shuffle():
  random.shuffle(deck)

def hit():
  hand.append(deck.pop())




</code></pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          <pre><code class="language-python">def create_deck(): 
  return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def deal_initial_hand(deck):
  return [deck.pop(), deck.pop()]

def shuffle(deck):
  return random.shuffle(deck)

def hit(hand, deck):
  return hand.append(deck.pop())

def main():
  deck = create_deck()
  hand = deal_initial_hand(deck)
  hand = hit(hand, deck)</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        In order to do anything on the right side, you have to think about
        where the data lives and how it gets to your code. By comparison, on
        the left side all of the state you could ever need is right there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entanglement is the programmer's equivalent of eyeballing a measurement
        or cutting a corner. We could route our variables around such that each
        function is isolated, but it's tedious and requires thinking about
        interfaces. Much faster to write code quickly and see what pops out in
        the terminal and iterate on that till it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's important to note that programmers aren't just being lazy,
        this temptation is often grounded in logic. Justification comes in two
        flavors.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, programmers have deadlines, and a mountain of tasks. The
        programmer knows that it is hard to evaluate benefits that pay off over
        many weeks against a hypothetical. So if a client or manager needs
        something ASAP, the programmer takes on a lot of risk by saying 'no,
        this will take a while because it has to be done correctly' even if
        that is better for the long term. And those programmers who do request
        additional time might still be pressured into doing things 'quickly',
        because they may be convinced that they don't have the full scope
        necessary to prioritize short and long term goals. This is a failure of
        management and company culture, and while it <i>is</i> harmful, it's a
        thread to follow in a future piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, a lot of otherwise very smart people make the argument that the
        benefit of getting things out quickly outweighs the downstream costs.
        In my experience, the argument is generally some variation of: "by
        seeing this code in action we will have more clarity, and we might
        decide to throw this code out entirely. Writing it fast will help us
        decide what code to write later and thereby save us time in the long
        run". Those same people will also say something like "obviously if
        we're writing code that is built to live a long time, we should do it
        the right way. But for prototyping, it's ok or even good to do things
        fast." This is much more interesting to me, because…
      </p>
      <h6>The Tools are not the Artifact</h6>
      <p>
        …I strongly disagree. For prototyping, it's much better to produce good
        simple code that may have been harder to write, than bad complex
        entangled code that was easy to write.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most disciplines, the tools are not the artifact. Pianists don't
        <i>make</i> pianos, they make music. Authors don't make word
        processors, they create characters and worlds (we make the word
        processors!). In general, most engineers don't make the tools they use.
        Mechanical engineers working in a shop don't make the drills and
        presses; electrical engineers don't make the opamps and breadboards.
      </p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/mozart.jpg" width="400" />
        <p>Pictured: someone who can't build pianos.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        In other fields, when you're working on a prototype, you buy tools that
        are explicitly designed for prototyping. These tools are flexible,
        modular, built to support rapid iteration and change. These tools are
        high quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming is a bit unique. Everything we do is code. Our artifacts
        are code. The things we use to produce those artifacts -- libraries,
        frameworks, whatever -- that's also code. It's code all the way down.
        And so it's really easy to blur the lines between the tool and the
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>Don't do this.</p>
      <p>
        It's because of that blurriness that smart people will say something
        crazy like 'we can write bad code because this is a prototype'. Can you
        imagine if we said that for any other field? Can you imagine an author
        going 'hey yea, this is just a draft so I'll be writing it using a
        shittier computer'? That doesn't even make sense! It's not even wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
        In every other field, the tools used for prototyping have the
        <i>most</i> simplicity. A machine shop vs an assembly line. A bread
        board vs a printed circuit. The tools used for prototyping are MORE
        modular, MORE separated. It’s no different in software engineering
        (which is, contrary to a certain strain of thinking, ALSO an
        engineering discipline!). The tools used to build the prototype are not
        the prototype.
      </p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/ee-prototypes.png" width="600" />
        <p>
          The breadboard on the left is what electrical engineers use to
          prototype. Look how modular and separable everything is! Every wire,
          every resistor, every opamp is modular and can easily be moved and
          adjusted, especially compared to the right side. Prototype with
          breadboards, not circuit boards.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Prototypes that involve CS are rarely, very rarely, testing the code
        itself. Rather, we are prototyping something built with code. A UI. A
        web app. A load balancer. These are applications, put to use by end
        users. And end users don't care about code. They don't care about how
        pretty it is, or how nice it is to read -- they only care about whether
        the code does what was asked. The number one property of a prototype is
        that it is subject to rapid change. <i>That is the ask</i>. That means
        you need to build the underlying tools in a way that will support rapid
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look at that blackjack code again, and imagine that you are now
        tasked with adding another player. Is the code on the left easy to
        change? No. In fact, if the design specification changes at all, you
        basically have to throw everything out and start over. This is
        incredibly slow, which means it is a bad prototype.
      </p>
      <p>
        When writing easy code, the artifacts that are created are
        fundamentally entangled with the task at hand. You cannot understand
        the value of the artifact without knowing about the task; without the
        task, the artifact has no value. This breaks the cardinal idea behind
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_4.html"
          >corkscrew-programming</a
        >, which is that every piece of generated code can be used to speed up
        and power all future code. If all of the code you create is entangled
        with the specific task it was created for, it can't be reused.
      </p>
      <h6>How To Write a Simple Prototype</h6>
      <p>
        There are a bunch of general heuristics about how to write simple code
        that apply here.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Write
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function"
            >pure functions</a
          >. Your functions should have as few dependencies on external things
          as possible, and all of those dependencies should be passed in
          through the parameters. If you pass the same parameters in, you
          should get the same values out.
        </li>
        <li>
          No global state. All state needs to be wrapped in something that can
          provide a pure function interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manipulate data. Take the time to write IO so that end users can pass
          in configuration to change how your code works without you having to
          be in the loop.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With prototyping in particular, there are a few other key steps that
        programmers can take.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Think deeply about what parts of your program are 'tools used to make
          the prototype' compared to 'the prototype'. Make sure the
          dependencies only ever go from the latter to the former.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the pieces of your program that are 'tools' and separate them
          into a different set of files. Clean them up, run a linter, get code
          review.
        </li>
        <li>
          Separate the two pieces of the program with configuration. The 'tools
          that make the prototype' parts of your code should take in some type
          of user input to produce the prototype.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And if you decide that your prototype is sufficiently small, keep it
        under 200 lines and then commit to throwing it away when it has served
        its purpose.
