          Anyone who says they're great at communicating but people are bad at
          listening is confused about how communication works.
        </p>

        Communication is what happens when person A takes information that
        lives in their mind, and successfully transfers it to person B.
        Organizations (including companies) exist because multiple people can
        work more efficiently on larger projects than an individual person.
        Naturally, communication is the lifeblood of an organization. An
        organization without communication isn't even an organization, it's
        just a bunch of random people doing things separately from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, it turns out communication is a fairly difficult task!
        Everyone comes to the table with different expectations, lived
        experiences, biases, and priors. This results in lost signal, as each
        person interprets the same input information through successive layers
        of personalized lenses and filters. I really liked
        <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/danluu/status/1487228574608211969"
          >this thread</a

        by Dan Luu that encapsulates the problem in an organizational setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get around this, we've invented all sorts of ways of communicating.
        In person face-to-face talking is one small, tiny part of the
        communication landscape; the vast majority is made up of writing and
        figures (including IM, email, documentation, figures, READMEs, and even
        code); and the rest is rounded out by video streaming, audio
        recordings, presentations, interpretive dance, and puppetry. Each of
        these modalities is best suited for a specific kind of information
        transfer, almost all of them benefit from special tooling and shared
        cultural standards, and all of them have their own set of difficulties.
        Sometimes the tooling sucks, sometimes tone or context or more is lost,
        sometimes people who are great at presentations are bad at writing
        emails or handling puppets. With long lasting communication, like a
        how-to guide, there is a ton of added complexity around just making
        sure that the right people even know the information is out there.
        Honestly, it's amazing we get anything done at all.
      </p>

        I thought communication at Google was really good — from the moment I
        joined the company, I almost never felt confused about what to do, who
        to talk to, what the focus of my team/org/company was. The main reason
        for this, without a doubt, is that Google is filled with helpful,
        talented people. I loved everyone I worked with and almost all of them
        were more than willing to answer random questions and teach me about
        [programming, operating inside of Google, dealing with relationships].
        But it's hard to get good people, and I don't want to focus too much on
        hiring practices here. Instead, I want to look at two other key aspects
        of Google's internal communication strategy: spectacular tooling and
        really strong cultural norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like I said above, communication comes in many forms. Google has tools
        for all of them. Some of these you might know from public use (gmail,
        docs, sheets, slides, meets, calendar). Some of these you may have
        heard of, like critique for code review and the internal okr trackers.
        And some are more unique to google, like gdoc, a markdown-esque
        language that was used for automatic website generation to treat
        'documentation as code', or YAQS, an internal stack overflow.
        Independently, I think these tools were mostly adequate, with the
        exception of critique which was really quite good. But they shone when
        they were put together, and they were unstoppable when combined with
        Google Groups and Google's internal search infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every single one of these tools was built to interoperate with all of
        the others. Some did this explicitly — for example, automatically
        including a Meets link with every calendar event — but most used email
        as a lingua franca. Share a doc? You get an email that could be used to
        reply without ever leaving the inbox. Comments on a design review? All
        editable from gmail. Code review coming in? Email. Calendar event?
        Email. Sending an email? Email. Almost every single thing that you
        could do could be accessed in your inbox.
      </p>

      <p>
        But your inbox didn't have to be your inbox. Google Groups were a
        ubiquitous way to create group inboxes that functioned identically to
        mailing lists. You could make a Group for anything, though many groups
        were automatically created as a reflection of the company hierarchy.
        (The moment I joined Google, I was automatically put into individual
        Groups for every manager in my chain, up to Sundar.) If everything can
        communicate via email, and you can set up group inboxes for arbitrarily
        granular groups of people, you can build automated fine grained
        communication channels. Suddenly, you can use any tool you want to
        communicate — really, whatever you are most comfortable with to get
        your point across — and you can be sure that it will get to the right
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Moma, Google's internal search engine, filled in the gaps for
        everything else. Moma automatically indexed everything you had access
        to, including calendar events, people in the directory, public group
        lists, everything in Drive, and, yes, your email(s). I briefly
        mentioned in
        <a href="https://amolkapoor.com/writing/founders_4.html"
          >Corkscrew Development</a
        >
        that simply letting people know your work exists can be a huge
        multiplier on how impactful it is. A search indexer like Moma is a
        natural end goal of that line of reasoning, because it can connect all
        of your company's information to everyone, present and future, who
        might need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my current team, we mostly use Slack, and a lot of really important
        communication gets totally buried and is impossible to find. Things
        like Q&A with the 'team expert', posting about/debugging errors, design
        discussions, etc. I think the real beauty of the system at Google is
        that it successfully captured all of the knowledge transfer that
        happened in casual email threads, and stored/indexed them so that
        anyone can find them later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the technology only goes so far. Google pairs all of this
        technical infrastructure with strong cultural norms. Folks do use IM
        (Google Chat, which is also indexed by Moma as an email!) but there is
        a real commitment to using email and Groups. Similarly, where possible,
        people try to share things globally, a natural consequence of deeply
        entrenched transparency. Virtually everything has a
        <a href="https://yiou.me/blog/posts/google-go-link/">go/link</a>, which
        makes hopping around from document to document easy and memorable. And
        of course, Memegen participation and consumption was a ubiquitous part
        of Google's company-wide communication, allowing far-flung employees to
        keep a near-instantaneous pulse on what was happening. On a meta level,
        there was a lot of really good documentation about how to deal with all
        of this infra. Googlers maintained an incredibly comprehensive
        glossary, which made it easy for newcomers to figure out how to parse a
        sentence like 'I fed Starburst and ICA into RedAnt for Ansible'. There
        were also a ton of self-made guides that linked to other important
        documents or video presentations. There was some onboarding cost, but
        all together the communication infrastructure was simultaneously
        distributed, comprehensive, and functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think communication at Google was still hard, but not nearly as bad
        as it could have been for a company that size. Even though I regularly
        worked with O(100s) of people from Mountainview, NYC, Zurich, and India
        I rarely felt like people were missing information and context. It's
        only now that I realize how impressive this feat was.
