      <h6>Be like the Venetian Arsenal</h6>
      <p>
        I want to preface this by pointing out that I am not, traditionally, a
        systems engineer. That title/role is a pretty specific one,
        meaningfully different from my past experiences as a SWE. That said,
        over the last two years I have spent a lot of time thinking about
        complex computer programs that can support a user-facing platform at
        scale. So I might not know the latest terminology, and I might be
        reinventing the wheel, but I figure I've picked up a thing or two worth
        sharing when it comes to building systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, a bit of history. Systems engineering far predates anything that
        could be meaningfully recognized as modern day computer science. The
        original use of the term can be traced back to Bell Labs, where it was
        originally used to describe the telecom network. But some of the
        principles of systems engineering go back farther – Ford factories in
        the early 1900s, Carnegie railroads and Rockefeller oil in the 1800s.
        My personal favorite is the Venetian Arsenal, a massive ship building
        enterprise that, in the 1400s, was the world's first industrial
        factory.
      </p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/arsenal.jpg" width="700" />
        <p>
          At it's height, the Venetian Arsenal could pump out a new warship
          <i>every day</i>. The equivalent process would take competing world
          powers 6 months. The Arsenal made Venice, a city of only 100k people,
          the most powerful naval force in the Mediterranean and possibly the
          world.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Telecoms, manufacturing, transport, energy, shipbuilding – all of these
        'systems' faced the same underlying problem: "what is the optimal way
        to leverage a set of non-fungible resources to solve a set of
        non-fungible tasks?"
      </p>
      <p>
        In my mind, system design is the act of defining a set of related
        components, their communication channels, and their inputs/outputs, in
        order to solve that resource allocation problem. Because inputs to the
        system may vary significantly, it is often necessary for functional
        systems to define a structure that is easy to adapt to changing
        requirements, while being relatively resilient to unexpected failure
        (including, inevitably, human error).
      </p>
      <h6>Core Values in a Good System</h6>
      <p>
        Every system is different, but good systems tend to embody a few core
        values:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Failure is inevitable.</b> Long-lived systems tend to assume that
        failure will happen eventually, and as a result have comprehensive
        fallbacks. These systems are designed to avoid single points of
        failure, so that no one piece of the system can take down the entire
        thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Parallelization is good.</b> The more things that can happen at the
        same time, the faster the system can operate and the more throughput it
        can manage. The same set of tasks can be done faster, and costs can
        easily be measured by compute resources that can be quickly dialed up
        or down. Parallelization tends to reduce the surface area for failures.
        This is because a parallel system abstracts what (code is being run)
        from where (that code is being run). If there is a failure related to
        the where, we can easily recover by shifting the task load to another
        part of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        A necessary corollary is that <b>sequential operations are bad.</b> A
        sequential operation forces parts of the system to wait on some other
        part. This incurs wait time, which tends to be wasted or, at the least,
        used inefficiently. Where possible, we want the components of our
        system to avoid direct dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Async is good.</b> An async system has components that can operate
        independently of each other, on their own time frames. To accomplish
        this, asynchronous modules collocate all of the dependencies necessary
        to perform an atomically useful task. Async modules require async
        communication – a byproduct of an asynchronous system is a framework
        that emphasizes few messages packed with necessary information, instead
        of many small updates. All of this tends to result in fewer single
        points of failure; and such a system is more easily parallelized, with
        lower scheduling overhead. Because an async module cannot necessarily
        rely on responses from other modules, each individual module also tends
        to be more independent, more easily understood, and more reusable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Standardized parts are good.</b> Every layer of the system should be
        composed of plug-and-play building blocks that are in turn reusable and
        opinionated. The process of creating the parts should be mostly
        separated from the process of putting them together. Separating and
        standardizing components makes a system more legible, because
        understanding a piece of code in one area of the system can help
        provide context for other areas of the system. It also enables
        flexibility and better extensibility – with standardized components, it
        is far easier to work at higher levels of abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Externalizing information is good.</b> Complex systems are, by their
        very nature, difficult to fully understand. Some systems may reach a
        size where complete understanding is impossible for a single human. At
        this scale, communication between various components is critical so
        that the system remains legible upon inspection. In computer systems,
        this often manifests in two ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          logs. Lots and lots of logs. Good, queryable system logs make it easy
          to track down bugs, head off failures, and optimize efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          modules over-exposing information such that future modules can ingest
          that data, potentially without any knowledge of what the rest of the
          system needs to know (see:
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern"
            >pub/sub</a
          >). Such an architecture provides natural hooks for future
          extensibility.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>And so on.</b> Many systems I've worked with, studied, or
        implemented have other things in common – for example, Unix philosophy
        'do one thing well' shows up a lot – but from a values perspective I
        think the above four principles are pretty solid. A system that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>prepares for failure,</li>
        <li>prioritizes parallelization,</li>
        <li>incorporates asynchronous processes,</li>
        <li>and externalizes information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        is likely to be a robust, flexible, long-lived solution to the problem
        being solved.
      </p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/logs.jpg" width="700" />
        <p>Pictured: one of the hallmarks of a good system.</p>
      </div>
      <h6>Human Resources</h6>
      <p>
        At the top, I said that all systems are trying to answer the same
        question: "what is the optimal way to leverage a set of non-fungible
        resources to solve a set of non-fungible tasks?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to put too fine a point on it: this is the same problem that faces
        every business in the world. Given a fixed set of resources (employee
        hours), how can we { build the product, respond to customer feedback,
        build our community, … }. Turns out, there's a few things we can learn
        from the systems engineering principles above.
      </p>
      <p>
        The throughline is simple: empower the individual. A good human system
        is one where individual people are able to quickly and accurately make
        important decisions about how to best accomplish their tasks within the
        larger organization. This allows them to act asynchronously and in
        parallel, almost by default.
      </p>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="img/hr.jpg" width="700" />
        <p>
          Given how most people talk about HR departments, my guess is they are
          not great at empowering individuals.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Within a team:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There should be specific procedures in place to ingest, prioritize,
          and distribute tasks to the broader team. Individual people within
          the team should understand a) what tasks are available in what
          priority; b) how to 'take' a task such that no one else is working on
          it; c) how to report task completion. To parallelize efficiently, we
          want to avoid questions like 'what should I work on next'.
        </li>
        <li>
          Related: ensure that responsiblilities are clearly defined. There
          should never be a question about who is responsible for a task. Each
          task should have one designated leader for whom responsibility rolls
          up to. This ensures that there is no duplication of effort; it also
          ensures that people cannot hide behind uncertainty.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a general rule, hire generalists (pun unintended). A generalist
          can take on a wider range of tasks, and is capable of parallelizing
          more easily even if they take longer to complete specific sub-tasks.
          The natural computing equivalent is choice of server – sometimes you
          do need a GPU Accelerator for something really specific, but the bulk
          of your work is going to be done on standard CPU machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a culture of documenting and sharing everything. Create a
          glossary early on, so that there is a lingua franca. Have a way to
          search through past documents, and hook up all of your platforms to
          the same search tool. Make sure that any additional information can
          be easily acquired without having to ask another person, thereby
          avoiding sequential blockers. Have procedures in place for
          documenting question-answers for those cases where the existing
          tooling fails or some piece of knowledge is not institutionally
          known. Encourage the team to 'log' loudly on (slack, email) when
          things aren't going as expected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicate new changes frequently. Have a meta-process (like code
          review) that a) requires at least one other person on the team to be
          aware of a change and b) specifically evaluates how discoverable and
          comprehensible the change is. Randomly surface old ideas, concepts,
          changes to increase discoverability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid interruptions and interrupting. Focus on asynchronous methods
          of communication, like email, instead of synchronous messaging like
          slack or meetings. Ensure that your asynchronous communication
          actually contains all of the relevant information, such that it can
          meaningfully remain asynchronous. (See:
          <a href="./code_review.html">On Code Review</a> for more)
        </li>
        <li>
          Create and follow patterns. Set and reuse templates, use the same
          naming conventions, avoid 'uniqueness' where possible. Try and design
          a world where people can guess what information they need and where
          they can find it from previous observations alone.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Between teams:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Collocate decision making authority so that a team can operate
          without needing to wait for other teams.
        </li>
        <li>
          All teams should communicate regularly using a pub/sub model. Each
          team should, on some regular interval (no more than monthly), publish
          anything relevant about the team; and all other teams should, on some
          regular interval, take stock of the most recent 'publications' from
          other teams to inform their own internal agenda.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure all documentation within a team is available to other teams
          by default. Allow other folks from other teams to 'subscribe' to
          updates by joining groups, slack channels, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Treat individuals as a separate abstraction from teams. Allow
          individuals to move between teams freely; allocate employee hours
          based on team priority, instead of isolating resources to specific
          teams. (However, be sure to account for context shift and onboarding
          costs when moving folks across team boundaries. )
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure dependencies across teams (where they are unavoidable) are
          based on milestones instead of timelines. Only start working on a
          project when the necessary inputs are available; do not pre-deploy
          resources expecting a certain output from another team, as this
          creates unnecessary dependencies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And remember: failure is inevitable. Assume that people will
        miscommunicate. Assume that information will be lost to the ether. Look
        for ways to protect against these things by having a culture of
        over-communicating and over-documenting.

      <h6>One huge caveat</h6>
      <p>All of the above only works in a high trust organization.</p>
      <p>
        Imagine a system where you have a set of trusted computers behind the
        same firewall -- if you know they will all behave, you can reduce
        systemic complexity by lowering monitoring and security costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same applies for individuals. Empowering individuals in a team
        necessarily means that you trust those individuals to make good
        decisions, and you can let them operate without constant oversight. If
        you don't trust your team, you will need to add additional layers of
        complexity to ensure that they are doing what you expect them to do.
        For SOOT, a deep tech company that is solving some pretty gnarly
        technical problems, we avoided this problem by ensuring our hiring
        funnel was extremely rigorous. For a company that is doing something
        more basic, like a CRUD app, it may be worth having lower individual
        autonomy in exchange for cheaper hiring.
