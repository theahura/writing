    <h4>Simple DL Part 3: Losses</h4>
    <h6>December, 2020</h6>

    <div class="writing">
      <h6>Recap</h6>
      <p>
        In the <a href="./simple2l_2.html">last section</a> we talked
        extensively about embeddings: what they are, how they worked, and why
        they are important. An embedding as a list of floats that carries some
        information about a concept; because embeddings are continuous
        representations, they can turn concepts into computation. A set of
        embeddings can be thought of as points on a map, that somehow represents
        the underlying 'important' structure of the things we are learning
        about. Loss functions are used to manipulate embeddings in a deep neural
        network -- in this section, we look at loss functions in more depth.
      </p>
      <h6>TLDR</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Loss functions are how we tell the model what information to emphasize
          or to throw away.
        </li>
        <li>
          If an embedding is a map, the loss is the cartographer.
        </li>
        <li>
          When thinking about losses, we care about three things: what the model
          produces, what we are comparing against, and how we do the comparison.
        </li>
        <li>
          Losses can be placed on any embedding -- they do not just have to be
          at the end. The closer a loss is to an embedding, the more influence
          it will have.
        </li>
